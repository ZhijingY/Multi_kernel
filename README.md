Multi-kernel program based on [Vitis concurrent kernel tutorial](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Accel_Examples/tree/2021.1/host/concurrent_kernel_execution), applied amendments so the code works on 2021 version of vitis.

Used stall_trace feature to observe the different stall time applied on each kernel.
